    <p class="element-type-selector">Element Type Selectors</p>
    <p class="element-type-selector">Element type selectors allow you to style specific HTML elements by their tag name. For instance, if you want to style all  elements, you can use "p" as your selector. They are broad and apply to all instances of the specified element type on the page, making them useful for applying consistent styles to all occurrences of a particular HTML tag.</p>

    <p class="class-selector-paragraph">Class Selectors</p>
    <p class="class-selector-paragraph">Class selectors are a way to apply specific styles to HTML elements that share the same class attribute. You define a class selector by adding a dot (.) followed by the class name to your CSS. They are useful for applying consistent styles to multiple elements without affecting other elements on the page.</p>

    <p id="id-selector-paragraph">ID Selector</p>
    <p id="id-selector-paragraph">ID selectors allow you to style a specific HTML element using its unique identifier. You define an ID selector by adding a hash (#) followed by the ID name to your CSS. Applying styles to an element with an ID selector will only affect that specific element, making it useful for targeted styling of individual page elements.</p>

    <p class="simple-selector-paragraph">Simple Selector</p>
    <p class="simple-selector-paragraph">A simple selector is the most basic type of CSS selector. It targets HTML elements without the need for classes or IDs. They are versatile and allow you to apply consistent styles to multiple elements of the same type.</p>

    <p class="universal-selector-paragraph">Universal Selector</p>
    <p class="universal-selector-paragraph">The Universal Selector, denoted by an asterisk (*), is the most generic of CSS selectors. It matches any and all elements on a web page. While it is powerful, it should be used with caution. Universal selectors can be helpful when you want to define a style that applies globally across all elements, but use them sparingly to avoid unintended consequences.</p>

    <p class="pseudo-class-selector-paragraph">Pseudo-Class Selectors</p>
    <p class="pseudo-class-selector-paragraph">Pseudo-class selectors allow you to style elements based on their state or position, such as hover, active, first-child, and more. They are preceded by a colon (:), and they can be used to add interactivity and style variations to elements, enhancing the user experience.</p>
